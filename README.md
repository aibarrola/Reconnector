# Reconnector
Help keep track of your relationships in your network and remind you to keep in touch. 

## Inspiration
During the summer, I put myself out there to network and made sure to keep track of everyone I reached out to. However, it was difficult to remember which ones I haven't kept in touch with. I used Google Spreadsheets to keep track of information such as name, company, job title, last called, contact information, and Google Docs to write down all the insights and advice I got from them. However, the UI was hard to figure out which relationship I haven't kept in touch with. That is why we built Reconnector. created e wanted to create a website application that allowed users to easily add people to their network and remind them to

## What it does
Reconnector is a network management tool. The purpose is to allow users to easily add people to their networks and remind them to keep in touch so they never lose a relationship. You must put in the effort to catch up your relationships and this website will help you do it so you will never forget. Some features include creating an account and adding connections. You can add a connection and put in the following information: Company, job title, contact information, and frequency (how often you want to keep in touch).

## How we built it
We built this website using React in order to develop the front-end client side of Reconnector as well as Firebase to create, read, update, and authenticate contacts and user accounts.

## Challenges I ran into
Our group members had no to little experience with React and none of us used Firebase. This means it was a steep learning and dedicated a lot of time to reading documentation and watching videos.

Another challenge was to include updates on catching up with a certain person through email. However, we had to cut our MVC to not include email notifications due to time restrictions.

Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Angelo - I'm proud of being able to use React to create the frontend. I designed the landing page and parts of the home page to allow easy and intuitive use of the website.

We are proud of building this project together even through the time differences.

## What I learned
Angelo - I learned a lot on how to work together in a team to build a project from scratch. Also was able to learn about how firebase works and implementing it with React. This was my first hackathon so there were a lot of firsts, it was a lot of fun so I can't wait to attend more in the future!

## What's next for Reconnector
Implement mail notifications
Use sorting algorithm to sort relationships based on the last time you contacted them
Adding customizable tabs to organize relationships from professional and personal We are going to continue to finish this project and deploy it for the public to use!
